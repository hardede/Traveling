## About Project
___

While developing this site, I used React and Node js to do a full user registration with sending data to the database. This is not my first React project but this is my first time using Nodejs. This project took me a lot of time, but I improved my React skills a lot. In the future, I will refactor the code when my knowledge allows me to do this. Any criticism is welcomed I will be glad to hear your opinion.
